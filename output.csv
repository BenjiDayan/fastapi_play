Mortal lovers must not try to remain at the first step; for lasting passion is the dream of a harlot and from it we wake in despair.^C. S. Lewis^'The Pilgrim's Regress'

Do not, for one repulse, forego the purpose that you resolved to effect.^William Shakespeare^'The Tempest'
Nothing in the world can take the place of Persistence.  Talent will not; nothing is more common than unsuccessful men with talent.  Genius will not; unrewarded genius is almost a proverb.  Education will not; the world is full of educated derelicts.  Persistence and determination alone are omnipotent. The slogan 'Press On' has solved and always will solve the problems of the human race.^Calvin Coolidge^30th president of US  (1872 - 1933)

When the conduct of men is designed to be influenced, persuasion, kind unassuming persuasion, should ever be adopted. It is an old and true maxim that 'a drop of honey catches more flies than a gallon of gall.' So with men. If you would win a man to your cause, first convince him that you are his sincere friend. Therein is a drop of honey that catches his heart, which, say what he will, is the great highroad to his reason, and which, once gained, you will find but little trouble in convincing him of the justice of your cause, if indeed that cause is really a good one.^Abraham Lincoln^16th president of US  (1809 - 1865)

When we are planning for posterity, we ought to remember that virtue is not hereditary.^Thomas Paine^US patriot & political philosopher  (1737 - 1809)

Do not be awe struck by other people and try to copy them. Nobody can be you as efficiently as you can.^Norman Vincent Peale^US clergyman  (1898 - 1993)
If you think you can win, you can win. Faith is necessary to victory.^William Hazlitt^English essayist  (1778 - 1830)
Don't be discouraged by a failure. It can be a positive experience. Failure is, in a sense, the highway to success, inasmuch as every discovery of what is false leads us to seek earnestly after what is true, and every fresh experience points out some form of error which we shall afterwards carefully avoid.^John Keats^English lyric poet  (1795 - 1821)
The way you overcome shyness is to become so wrapped up in something that you forget to be afraid.^Lady Bird Johnson^US wife of Lyndon Johnson 1934  (1912 - 2007)

Let not thy will roar, when thy power can but whisper.^Dr. Thomas Fuller^Gnomologia, 1732
Far better to think historically, to remember the lessons of the past. Thus, far better to conceive of power as consisting in part of the knowledge of when not to use all the power you have. Far better to be one who knows that if you reserve the power not to use all your power, you will lead others far more successfully and well.^A. Bartlett Giamatti^President of Yale University
Whenever you commend, add your reasons for doing so; it is this which distinguishes the approbation of a man of sense from the flattery of sycophants and admiration of fools.^Sir Richard Steele^

The time to pray is not when we are in a tight spot but just as soon as we get out of it.^Josh Billings^US Humorist  (1818 - 1885)

Shake off all the fears of servile prejudices, under which weak minds are servilely crouched. Fix reason firmly in her seat, and call on her tribunal for every fact, every opinion. Question with boldness even the existence of a God; because, if there be one, he must more approve of the homage of reason than that of blindfolded fear.^Thomas Jefferson^3rd president of US  (1743 - 1826)
The superior man, when resting in safety, does not forget that danger may come. When in a state of security he does not forget the possibility of ruin. When all is orderly, he does not forget that disorder may come. Thus his person is not endangered, and his States and all their clans are preserved.^Confucius^Chinese philosopher & reformer  (551 BC - 479 BC)

When you are not practicing, remember, someone somewhere is practicing, and when you meet him he will win.^Ed Macauley^
Remember! Things in life will not always run smoothly. Sometimes we will be rising toward the heights - then all will seem to reverse itself and start downward.

Behold the turtle. He makes progress only when he sticks his neck out.^James Bryant Conant^US chemist, diplomat, & educator  (1893 - 1978)
There is no law of progress. Our future is in our own hands, to make or to mar. It will be an uphill fight to the end, and would we have it otherwise?

Reading maketh a full man, conference a ready man, and writing an exact man.^Sir Francis Bacon^English author, courtier, & philosopher  (1561 - 1626)

When you play, play hard; when you work, don't play at all.^Theodore Roosevelt^26th president of US  (1858 - 1919)
You cannot go around and keep score. If you keep score on the good things and the bad things, you'll find out that you're a very miserable person.

Whatever you are, be a good one.^Abraham Lincoln^16th president of US  (1809 - 1865)
Regard your good name as the richest jewel you can possibly be possessed of - for credit is like fire; when once you have kindled it you may easily preserve it, but if you once extinguish it, you will find it an arduous task to rekindle it again. The way to gain a good reputation is to endeavor to be what you desire to appear.^Socrates^Greek philosopher in Athens  (469 BC - 399 BC)

Living apart and at peace with myself, I came to realize more vividly the meaning of the doctrine of acceptance.

Hands off!^Henry Miller^US author  (1891 - 1980)
